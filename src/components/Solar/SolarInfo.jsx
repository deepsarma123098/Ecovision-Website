      <h1>Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of power derived from the sun's radiation. It is harnessed using solar panels, which convert sunlight into electricity through a process known as the photovoltaic effect. This energy can be used for various applications, including powering homes, businesses, and industrial operations.
      Solar energy offsets about 0.85 - 1 kg of CO₂ per kWh compared to coal-based electricity.
      A 5 kW solar system produces about 6,000 - 7,000 kWh per year. CO₂ reduction: 5,100 - 7,000 kg (5.1 - 7 metric tons) per year.This is equivalent to planting about 200-300 trees annually.</h1>
